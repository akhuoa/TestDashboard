# Flatmap Viewer
The Flatmap Viewer (or Flatmap Selector) uses the abi-software flatmapvuer to display a flatmap of the vagus nerve that can be used to filter down to an image, by its anatomical location on the nerve.

There are no properties specific to the Flatmap Viewer at this time. 

# Events
The Flatmap emits the event "FlatmapViewer-selectImage" that is fired when an image is selected on the flat map. 
```js
    import {inject} from 'vue';
    const emitter = inject('emitter');
    
    emitter.on('FlatmapViewer-selectImage', (selectedImage) => { 
        //do something
    });
```
