**ComponentName** - this is the unique name of the component, how it appears in the drop down as well as the file name.

**key/value pair** - an array of key value pairs that tell the opener the properties that need to be passed down to the component.

key - property name

value - property value

**Listener**

    import {inject} from 'vue';
    const emitter = inject('emitter');
    
    emitter.on('ComponentName-componentEvent', (payload) => { 
        //do something
    });
```

### Properties
**defineProps** - define the properties you want to be passed to your component
```js
    const props = defineProps({
        propertyName:{
                type:String,
                required:true
        }
    })
